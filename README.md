# alg-int-calc-scala

The Algebraic Integer Calculator project, but in Scala, using TDD more 
thoroughly.

I started this project on Scala 2.13 under Java 8, with JUnit 4. Even though I 
have upgraded to Java 21, I'm still using Java 8 for this project. But I've been 
gradually upgrading the tests to JUnit 5.7.
